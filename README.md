# Christine Hou's Webpage

Welcome to Christine Hou's GitHub Page.

This page is to conduct analysis on the crime data of the City of Los Angeles from 2020 to present collected by **Los Angeles Police Department**.(Link: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8#:\~:text=from%202020%20to-,Present,-Public%20Safety)

The dataset is also stored in this GitHub page named **data.zip** for convinience.

To conduct analysis,

1)  Overview

-   Check how many columns/rows, how many NA values in every column, and etc.

2)  Data Analysis

-   In this analysis, the intended audiences would be the policymakers who want to improve the safety of the city, and probably the future residents to consider the living area if they want to move into the City of Los Angeles later.

-   I paid more attention on answering **\[What are the features of victims in the City of Los Angeles?** I want to know how the gender, age, race, and the time of the year is related to the criminal cases.

-   I used multiple packages, but the main two packages are `ggplot2` for plots and `dplyr` for wrangling dataset.

-   There are four subsections for data analysis to analyze four factors mentioned above respectively. Every subsection has one plot to visualize the information.
