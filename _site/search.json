    "text": "Data Information\nGaining aspirations from the experts(Campedelli, Aziani, and Favarin 2020; Hussain et al. 2022), I chose the newst crime data from Los Angeles Open Data - Public Safety-Crime Data from 2020 to Present(Department 2020), and it includes the information about crimes happened since Febraury 10, 2020, provided by LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department). I downloaded the dataset and began to conduct the analysis on November 5, 2023, and becuase the website is updated weekly, the dataset I analyzed on my web page only contains the crime information from Febraury 10, 2020 to November 1, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can choose to click the link and export the dataset using the ‘Export’ buttom on the web page. You can also choose to download data.zip from my GitHub directory. I compressed the dataset into data.zip, and stored it in GitHub directory for convenience. If the website accidently expires, you can get access to the dataset by visiting my GitHub directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll data in the dataset was obtained from the crime paper report, so if the paper report provided inaccurate or wrong information, the dataset may be not 100% accurate. But the dataset truly reflects the content of paper report."

Since Febraury 10, 2020 which is the start time of data update, the criminal cases in the City of Los Angeles is gradually increasing, even though there were some small decrease during the period. I paid more attention on how the criminal cases are related to victims’ gender, age, and race. In general,\n\nThe number of male victims was more than that of female victims;\nYounger people (0-40 years old) were more likely to be attacked;\nHispanic/Latin/Mexican (H), White (W), Asian (A), and Black (B) people were main victims.\nMany criminal cases tended to happen in the second six months from 2020 to 2023.\n\n\n\nFunctions Used\n\ndplyr\n\n\nfilter()\nselect()\nsummarize()\nmutate()\narrange()\ngroup_by()\ncase_when()\n\n\ntidyr\n\n\npivot_wider()\n\n\nggplot2\n\n\nggplot()\ngeom_line()\ngeom_point()\ngeom_smooth()\ngeom_boxplot()\nfacet_wrap()\nscale_x_continuous()\nscale_color_manual()\nlabs()\ntheme()\ntheme_classic()"
